## This project is a part of 22/23 Deep Learning module at University of Leeds.

The aim of the project is to classify the images data set and improve the accuracy by some useful techniques as following:

1. Key concepts of images preprocessing
2. Implement the Multi-layer Perceptons model
3. Implement the Convolution Neural Network model
4. Model evaluations - confusion matrix and ROC curves
5. Overfitting and underfitting by train-test curve
6. Methods of Tackling overfitting - Data augmentation, dropout, hyperparameter tuning
7. Transfer learning
8. Explainable AI using Grad_CAM

**Key library: ** Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotlib, PyTorch, h5py
